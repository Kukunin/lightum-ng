Lightum-ng is the fork of [lightum](https://github.com/poliva/lightum) porject.

Lightum-ng is a daemon to control the keyboard brightness and screen backlight on computer based on several inputs: light sensors, webcam or part of day.

Original lightum project is aimed only on Macbook notebooks, has only several backends and has hard to extend architecture (IMHO).
It works fine on the Macbook with Gnome or KDE environments.

Lightum-ng is aimed to support more computers, more sensors and backends. It will have the easy to extend architecture, written on C++ with minimum dependencies (Only plugins will have some specific dependencies. You will able to compile it with various set of plugins).
